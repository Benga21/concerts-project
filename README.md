Here's the complete README.md  Concert Project:
## Project Overview
The Concert Project is a database application that manages information about K-pop bands, concert venues, and concerts. This project uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with a SQLite database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete entries related to bands, venues, and concerts.

## Features
- Add and manage bands and their hometowns.
- Add and manage concert venues and their locations.
- Schedule concerts that link bands to venues with specific dates.
- Retrieve and display concert information, including whether a concert is a hometown show.
